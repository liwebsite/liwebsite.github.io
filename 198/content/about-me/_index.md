    #this portion is written in TOML (Tom's Obvious Minimal Language)
    
    title = "About Me"
    #replace takes the filename and replaces all hyphens with spaces so that when it appears on your page, it's using spaces. The filename is used in the URL and URLs can't have spaces so use hyphen in the filename.
    #title converts to title-case (using capital letters for principal words only)

Hello! My name is William Li and I’m captivated with the post-production of films. I specialize in animations, editing, and rocking out on my clarinet. My fluency of the Chinese language attained me the position as media director in charge of video documentation and outreach for several Chinese theatrical student performances. I’ve created outreach animations that secured funding for a vital local transportation system and shot and edited lifestyle videos. I am also currently producing three independent films. 

I look forward to working with you on your next major project!
