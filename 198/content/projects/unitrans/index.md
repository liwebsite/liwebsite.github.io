I was part of the animation team that created this video to support Unitrans, an underfunded public bus system in Davis, California. Unitrans improves the environment by providing transportation for more than 10,000 students and community members daily which reduces the number of vehicles on the road. This video was shown to UC Davis administrators, broadcasted over 50 times daily in the UC Davis Student Union and generated campus-wide attention to the referendum. Voter turnout quadrupled compared with previous years and broke the university record in number of votes during the 2019 winter election at UC Davis.
