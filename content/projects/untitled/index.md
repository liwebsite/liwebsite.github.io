I co-wrote and edited this mockumentary that provides social commentary about today’s society in which the personality in front of a camera fails to reflect real life. Videos and images today are so easily craftable that creators can produce any reality of themselves without revealing their true nature. This video was my first foray into post-post production and I look back with contentment to see how much my editing has improved since this film.
